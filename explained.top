Ch_freq - the frequency you want to mix, or you want to tune in
bandwidht - the amount of data you want to see
tuning - can be done be either changing the ch_freq or by multiplying. the tuned frequency is the difference between the two multiplied signals
bandpass - if you want to remove side lobes in the negative frequencies, use complex taps
